# Network-forensics-Nodejs
A project that I have worked on along with a team member during my Master degree.
The project was about capturing pcap files through tcpdump tool then parse the pcap file using tshark to extract valuable information and use a web application to display the data using Angualr 1 for the front-end, and NodeJS for the back-end.


The tools were used are:
1- Tcpdump.
2- Tshark.
3- Nodejs.
4- AngularJs.
5- Python.
